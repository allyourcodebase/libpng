# libpng

This is [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) packaged for [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

## Anti-Endorsement

Personally, I would look for alternatives before using libpng, however I have
created this package because sometimes libpng is required deep in a dependency
tree and difficult to avoid. In particular the motivating package is FreeType.
